Major 3rd-Party Libraries

The Python standard library alone contains extensive functionality.
However, some tasks require the use of third-party libraries.
Some major third-party libraries:
Django: The most frequently used web framework written in Python,
Django powers websites that include Instagram and Disqus. It has many
useful features, and whatever features it lacks are covered by extension
packages. CherryPy and Flask are also popular web frameworks.

For scraping data from websites, the library BeautifulSoup is very useful,
and leads to better results than building your own scraper with regular expressions.
While Python does offer modules for programmatically accessing websites, such as
urllib, they are quite cumbersome to use. Third-party library requests make it much
easier to use HTTP requests.
'''

'''A number of third-party modules are available that make it much easier to carry out scientific
and mathematical computing with Python.
# The module matplotlib allows you to create graphs based on data in Python.'''

'''
The module NumPy allows for the use of multidimensional arrays that are much faster than the
native Python solution of nested lists.
It also contains functions to perform mathematical operations such as matrix transformations on the arrays. 
'''

# The library SciPy contains numerous extensions to the functionality of NumPy.

# Python can also be used for game development.
# Usually, it is used as a scripting language for
# games written in other languages, but it can be used to make games by itself.

For 3D games, the library Panda3D can be used. For 2D games, you can use pygame.

# As they are 3rd party modules we have to install by using
# pip install numpy, matplotlib,scipy

# The pip command is a tool for installing and managing Python packages,
# such as those found in the Python Package Index.

# for GUI development PyQt is the best

'''
A package is a collection of python modules under a common namespace.
In practice one is created by placing multiple python modules in a directory with a
special __init__.py module (file).

A module is a single file of python code that is meant to be imported.
This is a bit of a simplification since in practice quite a few modules
detect when they are run as script and do something special in that case.
