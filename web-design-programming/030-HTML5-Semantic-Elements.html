		<p> What are Semantic Elements?<br/>
		A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.<br/>

		Examples of non-semantic elements: ---div--- and ---span--- - Tells nothing about its content.<br/>

		Examples of semantic elements: ---form---, ---table---, and ---article--- - Clearly defines its content.</p>
		
		
		<h3>New Semantic Elements in HTML5</h3>
		<p>Many web sites contain HTML code like: ---div id="nav"--- ---div class="header"--- ---div id="footer"---<br/>
		to indicate navigation, header, and footer.<br/><br/>

		HTML5 offers new semantic elements to define different parts of a web page:  <br/><br/>
		-article<br/>
		-aside<br/>
		-details<br/>
		-figcaption<br/>
		-figure<br/>
		-footer<br/>
		-header<br/>
		-main<br/>
		-mark<br/>
		-nav<br/>
		-section<br/>
		-summary<br/>
		-time<br/>
		</p>
		
<!-- 		HTML5 <section> Element -->
		
		<h3>HTML5 ---section--- Element</h3>
		<p>The ---section--- element defines a section in a document.<br/>

		According to W3C's HTML5 documentation: "A section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading."<br/>

		A home page could normally be split into sections for introduction, content, and contact information.</p>
		
		
		<section>
		  <h1>WWF</h1>
		  <p>The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is an international organization working on issues regarding the conservation, research and restoration of the environment,
			  formerly named the World Wildlife Fund. WWF was founded in 1961.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
		  <h1>WWF's Panda symbol</h1>
		  <p>The Panda has become the symbol of WWF. The well-known panda logo of WWF originated from a panda named Chi
			  Chi that was transferred from the Beijing Zoo to the London Zoo in the same year of the establishment of WWF.</p>
		</section>
		
<!-- article    -->
		<h3>HTML5 ---article--- Element</h3>
		The ---article--- element specifies independent, self-contained content.<br/>

		An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to read it independently from the rest of the web site.<br/>

		Examples of where an ---article--- element can be used:<br/>

		Forum post<br/>
		Blog post<br/>
		Newspaper article<br/>
		
		<article>
		  <h1>What Does WWF Do?</h1>
		  <p>WWF's mission is to stop the degradation of our planet's natural environment, and build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature.</p>
		</article>

				
<!--        Nesting <article> in <section> or Vice Versa?
The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.

The <section> element defines section in a document.

Can we use the definitions to decide how to nest those elements? No, we cannot!

So, on the Internet, you will find HTML pages with <section> elements containing <article> elements, and <article> elements containing <sections> elements.

You will also find pages with <section> elements containing <section> elements, and <article> elements containing <article> elements.                 -->		

<!--             HTML5 <header> Element
The <header> element specifies a header for a document or section.

The <header> element should be used as a container for introductory content.

You can have several <header> elements in one document.

The following example defines a header for an article:                -->

	<article>
	  <header>
		<h1>What Does WWF Do?</h1>
		<p>WWF's mission:</p>
	  </header>
	  <p>WWF's mission is to stop the degradation of our planet's natural environment, and build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature.</p>
	</article>
		
<!-- HTML5 <footer> Element
The <footer> element specifies a footer for a document or section.

A <footer> element should contain information about its containing element.

A footer typically contains the author of the document, copyright information, links to terms of use, contact information, etc.

You may have several <footer> elements in one document.-->

<footer>
  <p>Posted by: Hege Refsnes</p>
  <p>Contact information: <a href="mailto:someone@example.com">
  someone@example.com</a></p>
</footer>

<!--  HTML5 <nav> Element
The <nav> element defines a set of navigation links.

Notice that NOT all links of a document should be inside a <nav> element. The <nav> element is intended only for major block of navigation links.-->

<nav>
  <a href="/html/">HTML</a> |
  <a href="/css/">CSS</a> |
  <a href="/js/">JavaScript</a> |
  <a href="/jquery/">jQuery</a>
</nav>

<!-- HTML5 <aside> Element
The <aside> element defines some content aside from the content it is placed in (like a sidebar).

The aside content should be related to the surrounding content.-->

<p>My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer.</p>

<aside>
  <h4>Epcot Center</h4>
  <p>The Epcot Center is a theme park in Disney World, Florida.</p>
</aside>

<!-- HTML5 <figure> and <figcaption> Elements
The purpose of a figure caption is to add a visual explanation to an image.

In HTML5, an image and a caption can be grouped together in a <figure> element:

The <img> element defines the image, the <figcaption> element defines the caption.
-->

<p>The Pulpit Rock is a massive cliff 604 metres (1982 feet) above Lysefjorden, opposite the Kjerag plateau, in Forsand,
	Ryfylke, Norway. The top of the cliff is approximately 25 by 25 metres (82 by 82 feet) square and almost flat, and is a famous tourist attraction in Norway.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="img_pulpit.jpg" alt="The Pulpit Rock" width="304" height="228">
  <figcaption>Fig.1 - The Pulpit Rock, Norway.</figcaption>
</figure>

<!-- Why Semantic Elements?
With HTML4, developers used their own id/class names to style elements: header, top, bottom, footer, menu, navigation, main, container, content, article, sidebar, topnav, etc.

This made it impossible for search engines to identify the correct web page content.

With the new HTML5 elements (<header> <footer> <nav> <section> <article>), this will become easier.

According to the W3C, a Semantic Web: "Allows data to be shared and reused across applications, enterprises, and communities."
