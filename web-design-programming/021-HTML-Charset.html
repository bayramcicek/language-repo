		<p>The default character encoding for HTML5 is UTF-8.</p>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<p>ASCII was the first character encoding standard (also called character set). <br>
		ASCII defined 128 different alphanumeric characters that could be used on the internet:<br>
		numbers (0-9), English letters (A-Z), and some special characters</p>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		
		<p>ANSI (Windows-1252) was the original Windows character set, with support for 256 different character codes.<br>

			ISO-8859-1 was the default character set for HTML 4. This character set also supported 256 different character codes.<br>

			Because ANSI and ISO-8859-1 were so limited, HTML 4 also supported UTF-8.</p>
