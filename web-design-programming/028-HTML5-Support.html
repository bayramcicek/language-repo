		<h2>Define Semantic Elements as Block Elements</h2>
		<p>HTML5 defines eight new semantic elements. All these are block-level elements.<br/><br/>

		To secure correct behavior in older browsers, you can set the CSS display property for these HTML elements to block:<br/>

		header, section, footer, aside, nav, main, article, figure {<br/>
			&nbsp display: block; <br/>
		}</p>
		
		<h1>A Heading</h1>
		<myHero>My Hero Element</myHero>
		
		<p>You could use the solution described above for all new HTML5 elements.<br/>

		However, IE8 (and earlier) does not allow styling of unknown elements!<br/><br/>

		Thankfully, Sjoerd Visscher created the HTML5Shiv! The HTML5Shiv is a JavaScript workaround to enable styling <br/>
		of HTML5 elements in versions of Internet Explorer prior to version 9.<br/><br/>

		You will require the HTML5shiv to provide compatibility for IE Browsers older than IE 9.</p>
		
		<!-- Syntax For HTML5Shiv
		The HTML5Shiv is placed within the <head> tag.

		The HTML5Shiv is a javascript file that is referenced in a <script> tag.

		You should use the HTML5Shiv when you are using the new HTML5 elements such as: <article>, <section>, <aside>, <nav>, <footer>.-->
