//    Constructors are special methods invoked when an object is created and are used to initialize them.
//    A constructor can be used to provide initial values for object attributes.

    //            - A constructor must have no explicit return type.

    // Getters and setters are fundamental building blocks for encapsulation

//  You can think of constructors as methods that will set up your class by default, so you donâ€™t need to repeat the same code every time.
