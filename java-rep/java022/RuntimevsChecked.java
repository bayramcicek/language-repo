Types of Exceptions

There are two exception types, checked and unchecked (also called runtime).
The main difference is that checked exceptions are checked when compiled, while unchecked exceptions are checked at runtime.
As mentioned in our previous lesson, Thread.sleep() throws an InterruptedException.
This is an example of a checked exception. Your code will not compile until you've handled the exception.

// It is good to know the Types of Exceptions because they can help you debug your code faster
